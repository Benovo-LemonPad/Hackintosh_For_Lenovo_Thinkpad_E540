# Mac OS Monterey Hackintosh for Lenovo Thinkpad E540.
I decided to make a Hackintosh using OpenCore instead of Clover since all the ones on Github used Clover.

# What works.
* Trackpad ✔
* Wi-Fi ✔
* Audio ✔
* Camera ✔
* USB ✔

# What doesn't work.
* ALS (Ambiant Light Sensor) ❌
* Bluetooth ❌
* Sleep Mode ❌
* You tell me the rest.

# Preparation.
## You'll need.
* (Atleast) 4 GB USB.
* Computer running Windows, Mac OS or Linux.

# Installation.
(NOTE) If you have a 32 GB USB or lower, continue with "Formating USBs with smaller storage sizes." If you have a USB with 64 GB or higher scroll down to "Formating USBs with larger storage sizes."

## Formating USBs with smaller storage sizes.
* Windows

1.) Open File Explorer and plug in your USB.

3.) Make sure your USB filesystem is FAT32, the name is EFI (case sensitive) and click on Start. (NOTE) This will erase all data from the USB!

  Sorry, there is no tutorial for Mac OS and Linux.

## Formating USBs with larger storage sizes.
* Windows

We will be using a free piece of software called Rufus which you can download at <a href="https://rufus.ie" target="_blank">https://rufus.ie.</a>

1.) Run the program and plug in your USB.

2.) Make sure that Rufus is set like this.

### Device Properties

* Device is your USB.
* Boot selection is non bootable.
* Partition scheme is GPT.

### Format Options

* Volume label is EFI (case sensitive).
* File system is Large FAT32.

3.) Click on START and then OK. (NOTE) This will erase all data on the USB!

* Mac OS/Linux

  Sorry, there is no tutorial for Mac OS and Linux.

## Getting the Mac OS installer.

* Windows

  1.) Download the "EFI.and.Mac.OS.Monterey.zip" from the releases page.

  2.) Extract the zip file.

  3.) Inside of the extracted folder there should be two folders called com.apple.recovery.boot and EFI. Copy these two folders to the USB.

* Mac OS/Linux

  Same steps for Windows.

## Changing BIOS Settings.

1.) Boot into your BIOS settings by pressing the F1 key on startup.

2.) Make sure that Secure Boot is turned off, Serial ATA (SATA) is set to AHCI and UEFI/Legacy Boot is set UEFI Only with CSM Support set to No.

3.) Save Changes.

# Mac OS Installation.

1.) Plug in your USB into one of the USB ports on your Thinkpad.

2.) On startup press the F12 key and select your USB.

3.) After waiting you should see a nice GUI (Graphical User Interface) with icons on them but the option we need is hidden. To fix this press the spacebar, wait until you see EFI dmg (External) and click on it.

4.) Once your at the Mac OS installer format your HDD/SSD with Disk Utility, connect to Wi-Fi and install Mac OS Monterey!
